## Conventions

- **Tier colour:** 🔴 CRITICAL / 🟡 STANDARD / 🟢 LIGHTWEIGHT (per Arbiter-Oink Phase 4 governance)
- **Auto-escalation:** if a diff touches one of the 7 Financial Hotpath functions, tier is upgraded to 🔴 regardless of proposal tier.
- **Status progression:** PLANNED → PROPOSAL → PROPOSAL_REVIEW → CODE → PR_REVIEW → CANARY → DONE
- **Timestamps** are rendered in CEST (UTC+2).
